* Background
I was working on development of AnnoletJS to demonstrate different features like
rennaration, tagging. And my friend was working on development of 
different tools(web services) which are demonstrated through Annolet. But this
is not scalable and also its difficult to work independently because Annolet needed
to be edited for accommodating each web service. So after discussion
with Sai sir we came with idea of /Aspect Oriented Programming approach/.

* Implementation
The project is divided into three parts
| Backend            | Middle | Frontend |
|--------------------+--------+----------|
| JSON Manifest file | Weaver | Annolet  |
| CSS files          |        |          |
| JS files           |        |          |
| HTML files         |        |          |

*** Backend
+ JSON matadata file will be provide information about web services.
+ metadata file contains information about location of webservice related files and action to
be performed by user  
  + name of button to be created
  + HTML and CSS files for UI
  + JS files for functionality
  + function to run on click of button
**** Webservice
+ These are the independent microservices for performing different tasks
+ Each microservice must contain an inital function named annolet_run() to start
the service.
+ Webservice developer should provide metadata.

*** Middle
Middle depends on backend. Frontend depends on middle.
+ Weaver is an aspect weaving microservice which will weave all webservices into Annolet
hence adding to frontend.
*** Frontend (annolet)
+ Will load
+ Weaver will take services from backend and weave them into Annolet which is the frontend.
+ Here user can interact with these services.

* Design
+ format of metadata file
#+begin_src js
{
 webServiceName:'' ,
 authorName:'' ,
 btn-name:'' ,
 jsFiles:['',] ,
 htmlFiles:['',] ,
 cssFiles:['',] ,
}
#+end_src
+ A function will populate Annolet menu after going through all metadata files.
